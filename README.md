# [NATO Alphabet Trainer]()



## About

React webapp for gamers/steam users to track the status of the games in their library. Users will be able to import their list of games upon signup. Each game can be marked as:
  - Current
  - Completed
  - Dropped
  - Planning

However, on initial sign-up all games will be marked as 'Planning' by default.
