# [NATO Alphabet Trainer](https://natoalphatrainer.surge.sh/)



## About

React webapp for users to practice/learn/test their knowledge of the NATO phonetic alphabet. Users will have 10 seconds to correctly type the word that corresponds to the displayed letter. Correct answer will be shown if the user does not provide the correct response before the timer is completed. If the timer runs out or the correct response is given, a new question/letter will be given to the user.
